# when2meet redesign
team: Esther Plants, Yoona Oh, and Varsha Veer

As part of the design track for HackRice 8, we decided to redesign the UI of when2meet.
A popular scheduling tool, when2meet offers a simple way for group members to coordinate
meetings and gatherings; however, much of the interface is rather non-intuitive and is
non-compliant with WCAG standards for accessibility. As a result, we wanted to
make the interface more accessible and user-friendly.
